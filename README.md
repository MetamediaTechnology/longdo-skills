# Longdo Skills

A [Claude Code plugin marketplace][marketplace] of AI-agent skills for building
with [Longdo][longdo] — maps, location services, and weather.

Point your AI coding agent at the skill you need and it picks up the patterns,
conventions, and gotchas to write correct Longdo code.

## Plugins

| Plugin | For | What it covers |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| **longdo-map-js** | Web frontend | Longdo Map v3 **JavaScript API** — HTML markers anchored exactly on their coordinate, directional/cluster markers, click handling, popups, UI, layer control, geolocation, place tags |
| **longdo-map-rest** | Any language / backend | Location **REST APIs** — search/suggest, geocode, reverse-geocode, routing (guide, GeoJSON, matrix, snap, span, TSP), traffic speed |
| **longdo-map-flutter** | Mobile | Official `longdo_maps_api3_flutter` **SDK** — `LongdoMapWidget`, events, markers, the Dart ⇄ JS bridge |
| **longdo-weather** | Any language / backend | Longdo **Weather API** — rain radar, current conditions, wind, forecasts *(endpoint specifics pending — see the skill)* |

Each plugin installs independently — install only what you use. A web developer
who never touches Flutter installs just `longdo-map-js`.

## Install (Claude Code)

```shell
/plugin marketplace add MetamediaTechnology/longdo-skills
/plugin install longdo-map-js@longdo
```

Then install any others you need:

```shell
/plugin install longdo-map-rest@longdo
/plugin install longdo-map-flutter@longdo
/plugin install longdo-weather@longdo
```

Refresh later with `/plugin marketplace update`.

> Using a different agent? Each skill is self-contained Markdown — drop the
> relevant `plugins/<name>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` into a skills directory your
> agent reads.

## For humans

If you're a developer looking to learn the Longdo APIs directly:

- 🗺️ **Live map examples:** https://mapdemo.longdo.com/
- 💡 **Official tips blog:** https://map-blog.longdo.com/longdo-map-api-tips/
- 📖 **JavaScript API docs:** https://map.longdo.com/docs/javascript/
- 🔌 **REST API docs:** https://map.longdo.com/docs/rest
- 📱 **Flutter SDK:** https://map.longdo.com/docs3/flutter/getting-start
- 🌤️ **Weather:** https://weather.longdo.com/
- 🔑 **Get a free API key:** https://api.longdo.com/console/

> **Note:** never commit a real API key. The JavaScript map key is exposed to the
> browser by design — restrict it to your domain(s) in the console. Treat REST
> and weather keys as backend secrets and call them server-side.
